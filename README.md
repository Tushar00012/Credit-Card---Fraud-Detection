Credit Card Fraud Detection


Overview

The Credit Card Fraud Detection project aims to identify fraudulent transactions in credit card datasets using advanced machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify transactions as legitimate or fraudulent, helping financial institutions and customers prevent fraud and secure their financial transactions.

Features
